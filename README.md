# Corona
A toolkit designed for custom C++ code injection in Super Mario Sunshine. This kit can be used to create new enemies, objects, bosses, items, anything you can imagine.

# Setting Up
Corona needs a few things to successfully run. First you need Python 3.6 to run the script that compiles your code. Make sure that you install the Python YAML library as well. 

Another thing that is required for use is CodeWarrior. You have the option of searching for one and praying that it works, or message me on Discord (shibboleet#1010) and I will give you the version that Nintendo used. This is preferred over other compilers because of how CodeWarrior deals with inheritance and other factors. Once you have CodeWarrior, place it in the CodeWarrior folder. The binary in CodeWarrior that compiles your code should be named "mwcceppc".

You will also need Ninji's program that injects the actual code into a DOL file, but this is supplied in the "Kamek" folder. The source to Kamek can be found [here.](https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek)

The last thing you will need to use this program is a symbols file. Sadly, only the NUS version is supported with symbols, with no intention of adding PAL or JAP until somebody generates a symbols text file in the same format for the region. The symbols used can be found in "symbols/symbols-us.txt". To generate this file, convertMap.py takes an IDA map file and converts it for use with Kamek. This also needs Python 3.6.

The last thing you will need is an actual project. I have supplied two in the "Projects" folder to use for example. Each project has a YAML that defines what source files to compile, where to inject the code into, and the output you wish to have. These parameters will be explained below.

# Compiling
To compile a project, you simply run the compileProject script. The syntax it uses is:

```
compileProject.py <ProjectName> [optional] <inputDOL> <outputDOL>
```
As noted, the input DOL and output DOL names are optional if you are not injecting into the DOL.

If your code fails to compile, read the error and attempt to fix it, and if you can't seem to get something to compile, contact me.

# Symbols
In order for the functions / classes that are in this kit to be used, you have to include the symbols for them. This is done by supplying the text files found in "Symbols". If you wish to create your own, you have to make sure that the symbols in the file match exactly to the ones found in the symbol map. If named correctly in IDA Pro, you can use File -> Produce File -> MAP File. When asked what to include, uncheck all possible options. Once the map has exported, simply run the convertMap script, using your map as an argument.

# YAML
As said above, the library uses a YAML file to determine what to do with your code. The comments next to each variable explains how it works.
```yaml
source_filenames:  // the filenames in "source" that you want to compile. It can be as many as you want, with respect to limits to where you can put your code.
    - "SpawnCoin"

baseAddress: 0x80001810 // the address the code will be injected at. Be careful with this one.
outputBinary: true // this will output the raw binary of your code.
outputGekko: false // this will output a Gekko code for use with cheats, etc
outputDOL: true // this will output a DOL file to use. If you have this set to true, you HAVE to specify the DOL names in the compile script!
```

# Bugs
If there's any bugs or errors that are spotted, open a Issue in the "Issues" tab and I'll try my best to resolve the error.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute to this repository, create a pull request! Be sure to follow the same naming convention, pointer placement for arguments: with the variable name and not the type. Make sure it compiles, obviously!
